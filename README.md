# CHAT-WITH-PDF-USING-GEMINI

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that enables users to interact with the content of PDF documents using natural language queries. By leveraging Google Generative AI and LangChain, the application processes uploaded PDFs, extracts their content, and creates a vector-based search mechanism for efficient information retrieval.
